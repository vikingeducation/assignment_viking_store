# Setting up Database in Rails


An imagined Viking Store is off the ground, Viking Commerce Inc has provided us with a detailed list of data requirements. They haven't provided us with any seed data to use.

In this model I fired Rails app, set up the data model based on their requirements and then populated the database with mock user details, demographic info, and historical orders as necessary. The major task was to figure out the data model for the project; going through the description of Viking Commerce's needs and using the ERM modeling process to figure out what tables and columns are necessary to make this app come to life.

This is one of the many sprints (Agile) done for Viking Code School, which finalized project is in the repository [Project Viking Store](https://github.com/Visiona/project_viking_store)
