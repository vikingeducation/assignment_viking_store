# Questions

1. If a user can have a varying number of addresses, how many would be the max? Should the database be enabled to store unlimited addresses associated with a user or just the default shipping and billing addresses?

If the user should have as many shipping/billing addresses as they want.. perhaps a join table?

2. Is it generally OK and efficient to store a status of an order in a separate table (OrderStatus)? Specifically pertaining to if it should be evaluated as a cart, purchase, part of a shipment etc...

This would work as follows, if the order's `status_id` is:

- 'not_purchased' it is a cart
- 'purchased' it is a purchase
- 'shipping' it is in route
- 'delivered' it is delivered
- 'refunded' it is refunded
- etc.. allows for scaling

This approach also strikes me as applicable to shipments (ShipmentStatus). Is this a good approach?

3. Storing credit cards in their own table? Credit card companies too? Phone numbers in their own table?
